# COO Matrix Multiplication using Apache Spark

This code demonstrates the multiplication of two small matrices represented in the Coordinate List (COO) format using Apache Spark's Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). The COO format represents a sparse matrix as a list of tuples (index, value), where each tuple corresponds to a non-zero element in the matrix.

## Requirements
- Apache Spark: Make sure you have Apache Spark installed and properly configured.
- Scala: This code is written in Scala and requires a Scala environment.

## Function Explanation

### COOMatrixMultiply

This function takes two RDDs representing matrices in COO format and returns the result of their multiplication as an RDD. The multiplication process involves the following steps:

1. Join Operation: Perform a join operation on the RDDs based on the common key (column index).
2. Product Calculation: Multiply the corresponding values from the joined RDD.
3. Summation: Sum the products for each unique key (row index, column index) to get the final result.

## Example

For the provided matrices `M` and `N`:

```
M = | 1.0  2.0 |
    | 3.0  4.0 |

N = | 5.0  6.0 |
    | 7.0  8.0 |
```

The result of their multiplication (`R`) will be:

```
R = | 19.0  22.0 |
    | 43.0  50.0 |
```
